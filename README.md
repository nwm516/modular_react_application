# Building a Modular React Application with Import/Export 
This was an assignment for a Web Application Development class. The main objective was "To gain hands-on experience with component modularity in React by creating a small application that utilizes both default and named imports/exports".

# How to run the application
Be sure to navigate to the appropriate project folder, which was locally named "react-modularity-assignment", and type "npm start" within the terminal. The application should run within moments thereafter!
